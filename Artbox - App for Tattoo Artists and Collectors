Artbox - App for Tattoo Artists and Collectors
Overview
Artbox is a user-friendly application designed specifically for tattoo artists and collectors. The app aims to combine elegance and functionality, drawing inspiration from the simplicity of Apple's designs. Our goal is to create a seamless user experience with a clean, intuitive interface that makes navigation effortless.

Features
1. Design Philosophy
Clean and Smart Interface: Artbox will feature a sleek design inspired by Appleâ€™s minimalistic approach. The app will be easy to use, with an emphasis on aesthetics and functionality.
Inspiration from Devinci: The design of Artbox should reflect the principles seen in Devinci, ensuring a high standard of user-friendly experience.

2. AI-Powered Art Generator
Precise Art Generation: The AI function of Artbox will generate tattoo designs that accurately reflect the user's input. For example, if a user types "palm tree with a sunset behind it," the result should precisely match this description, avoiding any unrelated elements.

3. Viewing Tattoo Designs
Camera Integration: Users can upload a photo from their camera roll to preview how a tattoo design will look on their skin. This functionality is similar to what Instagram and Snapchat offer.
Blank Body Canvas: Artbox will also provide the option to view the tattoo design on a blank body canvas. Users can select different body parts (e.g., arm, leg, back, chest) and body types (e.g., male or female) to visualize the tattoo in various positions.
